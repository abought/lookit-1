                <p>
                    Cognitive development is the science of what kids understand and how they learn. Researchers in
                    cognitive
                    development are interested in questions like...
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>what knowledge and abilities infants are born with, and what they have to learn from
                        experience
                    </li>
                    <li>how abilities like mathematical reasoning are organized and how they develop over time</li>
                    <li>what strategies children use to learn from the wide variety of data they observe</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A study is meant to answer a very specific question about how children learn or what they know.
                    For instance, our "Talking Faces" study asks, "Can infants and toddlers match a moving face to
                    the sound of its speech?" If they look at one type of face most of the time, then we can
                    conclude
                    that they're able to distinguish between the face that matches the sound and the one that
                    doesn't.

                <p>
                    If you have any children between 3 months and 7 years old and would like to participate,
                    create an account to see what we have going on for your child's age range.
                    You'll need a working webcam attached to your computer to participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you select a study, you'll be asked to read a consent form and record yourself stating that
                    you and your child agree to participate. Then we'll guide you through what will happen during
                    the study, including screenshots from any videos that will be shown. Depending on your child's
                    age, your child may answer questions directly or we may be looking for indirect signs of what
                    she thinks is going on--like how long she looks at a surprising outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some portions of the study will be automatically recorded using your webcam and sent securely to
                    our MIT lab. Trained researchers will watch the video and record your child's responses--for
                    instance, which way he pointed, or how long she looked at each image. We'll put these together
                    with responses from lots of other children to learn more about how kids think!

            <div>
                <p>
                    Rather than having the parent or legal guardian sign a form, we ask that you read aloud
                    (or sign in ASL) a statement of consent which is recorded using your webcam and sent back
                    to our lab. This statement holds the same weight as a signed form, but should be less hassle
                    for you. It also lets us verify that you understand written English and that you understand
                    you're being videotaped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The consent video is sent to our server immediately. If we receive a consent form that does
                    NOT clearly demonstrate informed consent--for instance, we see a parent and child but the
                    parent does not read the statement--any other data collected during the study will be deleted
                    without viewing.

                    are at the time of the study. Your video is transmitted over a secure https connection to our

                    Trained MIT researchers who have been approved to work on the "Lookit" project will watch the
                    video segments you send to mark down information specific to the study--for instance, what your

                    Whether anyone else may view the video depends on the privacy settings you confirm at the end of
                    the study. You can set your default preference under your account page. If you do not confirm
                    the privacy level at the end of the study, we treat the data as 'withdrawn' (even we won't watch

                        looking for 9 seconds at one image and 7 seconds at another image, or answering that the
                        object is called a brush. Your video will never be shared with other researchers, students,

                <p>
                    For children under about two years old, we usually design our studies to let their eyes do the
                    talking! We're interested in where on the screen your child looks and/or how long your child
                    looks at the screen rather than looking away. Our calibration videos help us get an idea of what
                    it looks like when your child is looking to the right or the left, so we can code the rest of
                    the video. Here is an example of several children watching our calibration video--it's easy to
                    see that they look to one side and then the other. (Their parents all gave special permission
                    for them to be featured on our website.) Your child's decisions about where to look can give us
                    lots of information about what he or she understands. Here are some of the techniques our lab
                    uses to learn more about how children learn.
                </p>
                <h4>Habituation</h4>
                <p>
                    In a habituation study, we first show infants many examples of one type of object or event, and
                    they lose interest over time. Infants typically look for a long time at the first pictures, but
                    then they start to look away more quickly. Once their looking times are much less than they were
                    initially, we show either a picture from a new category or a new picture from the familiar
                    category. If infants now look longer to the novel example, we can tell that they understood--and
                    got bored of--the category we showed initially.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Habituation requires waiting for each individual infant to achieve some threshold of
                    "boredness"--for instance, looking half as long at a picture as he or she did initially.
                    Sometimes this is impractical, and we use familiarization instead. In a familiarization study,
                    we show all babies the same number of examples, and then see how interested they are in the
                    familiar versus a new category. Younger infants and those who have seen few examples tend to
                    show a familiarity preference--they look longer at images similar to what they have seen before.
                    Older infants and those who have seen many examples tend to show a novelty preference--they look
                    longer at images that are different from the ones they saw before. You probably notice the same
                    phenomenon when you hear a new song on the radio: initially you don't recognize it; after it's
                    played several times you may like it and sing along; after it's played hundreds of times you
                    would choose to listen to anything else.
                </p>
                <h4>Violation of expectation</h4>
                <p>
                    Infants and children already have rich expectations about how events work. Children (and adults
                    for that matter) tend to look longer at things they find surprising, so in some cases, we can
                    take their looking times as a measure of how surprised they are.
                </p>
                <h4>Preferential looking</h4>
                <p>
                    Even when they seem to be passive observers, children are making lots of decisions about where
                    to look and what to pay attention to. In this technique, we present children with a choice
                    between two side-by-side images or videos, and see if children spend more time looking at one of
                    them. If they do show a preference, this also means that they can distinguish between the types
                    of images or videos!
                </p>
                <h4>Predective looking</h4>
                <p>
                    Children can often make sophisticated predictions about what they expect to see or hear next.
                    One way we can see those predictions in young children is to look at their eye movements. For
                    example, if a child sees a ball roll behind a barrier, he may look to the other edge of the
                    barrier, expecting the ball to emerge there. We may also set up artificial predictive
                    relationships--for instance, the syllable "da" means a toy will appear at the left of the
                    screen, and "ba" means a toy will appear at the right. Then we can see whether children learn
                    these relationships, and how they generalize, by watching where they look when they hear a
                    syllable.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Older children may simply be able to answer spoken questions about what they think is happening.
                    For instance, in the "Cause and Effect" study, children hear a story and are asked which of two
                    possible events caused Bunny's tummyache. In the "Learning from Others" study, two women call an
                    object two different made-up names, and children are asked which is the correct name for the
                    object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way we can learn about how older children (and adults) think is to measure their
                    reaction times. For instance, we might ask you to help your child learn to press one key when a
                    circle appears and another key when a square appears, and then look at factors that influence
                    how quickly they press a key.

                    Traditionally, developmental studies happen in a quiet room in a university lab. Researchers
                    call or email local parents to see if they'd like to take part and schedule an appointment for
                    them to come visit the lab. Why complement these in-lab studies with online ones? We're hoping
                    to...

                    you're welcome to try the study anyway. If your child is just below the minimum age for a study,

                    Sure! Right now, the instructions for children and parents are written only in English, so some
                    of them may be confusing to a child who does not hear English regularly. However, you're welcome
                    to try any of the studies and translate for your child if you can. If it matters for the study
                    whether your child speaks any languages besides English, we'll ask specifically. You can also
                    indicate the languages your child speaks or is learning to speak on your demographic survey.

                    Of course! We're interested in how all children learn and grow. If you'd like, you can make a
                    note of any developmental disorders in the comments section at the end of the study. Any health
                    information provided will be kept confidential. We are excited that in the future, online
                    studies may help more families participate in research to better understand their own children's
                    diagnoses.

                    One note: most of our studies include both images and sound, and may be hard to understand if
                    your child is blind or deaf. If you can, please feel free to help out by describing images or
                    signing.

            <div>
                <p>
                    If possible, we ask that each child participate separately, because we are interested in his or
                    her individual perception and judgments. When children participate together they generally
                    influence each other, which is a fascinating subject in its own right but usually not the focus
                    of our research.

                    We fully agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics <a
                        href="http://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Pages/Media-and-Children.aspx?nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token">advice</a>
                    that children learn best from people, not screens! However, our studies are not intended to
                    educate children, but to learn from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of a child's limited screen time, we hope that our studies will foster family
                    conversation and engagement with science that offsets the few minutes spent watching a video
                    instead of playing. And we do "walk the walk"--our own young children provide lots of feedback
                    on our studies before we make them available to you!

                    In general, no, there are no direct benefits from participating in our studies. We hope they are

                    Sometimes we do post studies as tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk so that we can reimburse
                    families for participation. You can check our current listings <a

                    Unfortunately, no, as we only interpret children's abilities and developmental trends as a
                    group. Usually, your child's individual responses (for instance, looking 23 seconds at picture 1
                    and only 12 seconds at picture 2) are not a reliable indicator of his or her personal beliefs
                    and abilities, so we do not want to misrepresent our work by providing individual results.
                    However, under "My account" you can track the studies your child has participated in. If you're
                    interested in your child's individual development, please see our {{#link-to "resources"}}
                    Resources{{/link-to}} section for fun at-home activities you can try with your child.

            <div>
                <p>
                    If you're using Chrome, and you're getting this message even though you can see your video and
                    see your audio level indicator moving up and down when you speak, this may be due to a known
                    problem with
                    the built-in Flash plugin that comes with Chrome. You can fix it by pointing your browser to
                    chrome://plugins, selecting "Details" at the top right, and looking for Adobe Flash Player.
                </p>
                <p><img src="assets/chromebug.png"></p>
                <p>
                    Disable the entry named "PepperFlashPlayer.plugin," highlighted above in red, by clicking
                    "Disable." If there is already another Flash plugin called "Flash Player.plugin," like the one
                    shown above in green, you're all set. If there is no other entry, you'll need to download the
                    stand-alone plugin from Flash <a href="https://get2.adobe.com/flashplayer/?no_redirect">here</a>.
                    Once you have only the plugin called "Flash Player.plugin" enabled, come back to Lookit and try
                    your consent recording again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the system Flash plugin doesn't show up in the list even after you've installed Flash,
                    you may need to go to chrome://flags and select 'Enable NPAPI.' After restarting Chrome,
                    you should see both Flash players in the list!
